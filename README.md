## Environment Setup and Application Run
This project is written in Go. To run this project, you need to have Go installed and set up on your local machine or IDE (I used IntelliJ).

In your local IDE, search for the "Go" plugin and install it.
 
Once the Go is installed in the IDE, follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Clone Repository**: Download this repository to your local machine using
   ```
   git clone [repository_link_here]
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to Repository**: Open your terminal and navigate to the repository folder.


3. **Initialize Go Modules (if needed):** If you're using Go modules, ensure that you've initialized your project by running the following command:
   ```
   go mod init your_project_name
   ```
      This command initializes a go.mod file to manage your project's dependencies.


4. **Install Dependencies**: Use the following command to download and install the project's dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

5. **Run Application**: Execute the following command to run the application:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```
